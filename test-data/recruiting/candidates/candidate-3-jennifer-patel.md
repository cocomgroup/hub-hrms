Strong healthcare marketer with excellent hospital relationships and understanding of post-acute continuum. Major concern is mindset shift from census-driven SNF environment to mission-driven hospice care.

- Experience with end-of-life care or terminal diagnoses
- Understanding of hospice as home-based service vs. facility
